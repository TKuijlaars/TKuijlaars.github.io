            <h1>Has the Netherlands reached the limits of its growth?</h1>
            <p>In October 2022 the Financial Times published an article claiming that the Netherlands may have reached the limits of
                its growth. I intend to test this hypothesis.
            </p>
            <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c56c9b2-f4ad-4956-9216-655acebd845d"><img src="FTNetherlands.PNG" class="tkimage"></a>

            <div class="chart" id="PRChart1"></div>

        <p>Another way of testing whether the Netherlands' economy is hitting its upper limit is testing how the companies
            based in the country are performing. Using machine learing I clustered time series data for the Amsterdam
            Exchange Index and 7 of the other largest market indices around the world across a 5 year time period and produced a Dendrogram.</p>
        <p>The chart below shows the 8 time series for the indices labeled by thei respective ticker, and are grouped by the similarity in their behaviour.
            The lower the number the smaller the sum of distances.
        </p>
        <p>Interestingly the Amsterdam Exchange Index (AEX) and the S&P500 (GSPC) are the most similar in behaviour.
            The S&P 500 is widely regarded as one of the best gauges for the entire equities market. The S&P 500 has 
            also been one of the best performing indices in recent history and has been emblematic of the growth of the US economy. The similarity in behaviour between the S&P and the
            AEX is indicative of the not only the strong performance of Dutch companies but also of the fact that the Netherlands has room to grow.
